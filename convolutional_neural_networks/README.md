# üëÅÔ∏è Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Bytes for Computer Vision

This section curates our GenAI Bytes dedicated to exploring Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their transformative impact on computer vision. Here, we break down the inner workings of CNNs‚Äîfrom convolution operations and pooling to deep architectures‚Äîusing **simple explanations and relatable analogies**. Whether you're new to the concept or looking to deepen your understanding, our goal is to make the mechanics of CNNs both intuitive and memorable.
